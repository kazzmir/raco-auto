This tool adds an 'auto' command to the raco tool from Racket. Auto will run a file by requiring it and install a compile-handler that will automatically keep dependancies compiled.

* Install

 If you have 'raco git' (https://github.com/samth/raco-git) installed then use
   $ raco git --github kazzmir raco-auto

 Otherwise check out from git and link it up using raco.
   $ git clone git://github.com/kazzmir/raco-auto.git
   $ raco link raco-auto
   $ raco setup raco-auto

* Example

something.rkt:

    #lang racket
    (require "z.rkt")

$ ls
z.rkt something.rkt
$ raco auto something.rkt
# z.rkt will be compiled when it is loaded
$ ls
z.rkt something.rkt compiled
$ ls compiled
z_rkt.dep z_rkt.zo

A new zo will be created in the following cases
 * no zo exists
 * source .rkt file is newer than the zo
 * zo fails to load (usually because it was compiled by an older version of racket)
