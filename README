This tool adds an 'auto' command to the raco tool from Racket. Auto will run a file by requiring it and install a compile-handler that will automatically keep dependancies compiled.

something.rkt:

    #lang racket
    (require "z.rkt")

$ ls
z.rkt something.rkt
$ raco auto something.rkt
# z.rkt will be compiled when it is loaded
$ ls
z.rkt something.rkt compiled
$ ls compiled
z_rkt.dep z_rkt.zo

A new zo will be created in the following cases
 * no zo exists
 * source .rkt file is newer than the zo
 * zo fails to load (usually because it was compiled by an older version of racket)
